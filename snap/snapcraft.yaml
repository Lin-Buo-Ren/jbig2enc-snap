title: JBIG2 Encoder
summary: An encoder for JBIG2
description: |
  JBIG2 encodes bi-level (1 bpp) images using a number of clever tricks to get better compression than G4. This encoder can:

  - Generate JBIG2 files, or fragments for embedding in PDFs
  - Generic region encoding
  - Perform symbol extraction, classification and text region coding
  - Perform refinement coding and,
  - Compress multipage documents

  **Snap-specific notes**

  This is NOT an official distribution of JBIG2 Encoder, please refer the snap's own issue tracker for support:
